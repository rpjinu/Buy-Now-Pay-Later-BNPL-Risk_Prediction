📌 Project Overview

Pay Now & Pay Later is a Machine Learning project designed to predict customer repayment behavior in a Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) system.

The model classifies customers into three categories:

🔴 Defaulted

🟡 Late Payment

🟢 Paid On Time

The goal of this project is to help financial institutions identify risky customers early and reduce credit loss.
